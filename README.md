# Employee-Attrition-Analysis
This project analyzes employee attrition using Excel Pivot Tables and Charts. The goal is to identify why employees leave, which categories are most affected, and what actions can reduce attrition. The dashboard visualizes patterns across salary, age, job roles, departments, performance, and work-life balance.
